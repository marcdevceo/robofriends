RoboFriends React App

The RoboFriends app is a React-based web application that allows users to interact with a dynamic list of robot friends. The app leverages the JSONPlaceholder API to fetch robot data and display it in an engaging and user-friendly interface.

App Description
Components
The core logic of the app is implemented in the App.js file. This file defines the main App class, which is a React component managing the state of the application. Key components include:

CardList: Displays a list of robot cards.
SearchBox: Provides a search input for users to filter robots.
Scroll: Implements a scrolling container for the robot cards.
Functionality
Upon loading, the app fetches robot data from the JSONPlaceholder API using the fetch method in the componentDidMount lifecycle method. The fetched data is then stored in the component's state.

Users can interact with the app through the search functionality. As they type in the search box, the list of displayed robot cards dynamically updates to show only the robots whose names match the entered search term. This is achieved through the onSearchChange method, updating the searchfield state.

A loading indicator is included to inform users that the app is fetching data, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.

Rendering
The render method is responsible for rendering the UI components based on the current state. The app checks for the presence of robot data before rendering the main content. If data is still being fetched, a loading message is displayed; otherwise, the robot cards, search box, and scrolling container are rendered.

Styling
The app's styles are defined in the App.css file, providing a clean and visually appealing design. The use of the Tachyons CSS framework enhances the overall styling and responsiveness of the app.

Code Structure
The code follows best practices for React development, employing class components and state management. The event handling and data manipulation are designed to ensure a seamless and intuitive user experience.
